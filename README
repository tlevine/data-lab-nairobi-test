I developed my answers on Python 2.7.9. Python 3 will not work.

Question 1. Using Python, scrape data from the UN Iraq website
----------------------------------------------------------------
Run the scraper like so.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ./question1.py

The URL of the Google spreadsheet will be printed to the terminal.
It will have one sheet for the data and one for the metadata.
It takes a while to upload, so the months are logged as well.Â 

Question 2. Correct Source Errors
----------------------------------------------------------------
The fixed code is in the directory "question2".
